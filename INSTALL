# BEEPy - A Python BEEP Library
# Copyright (c) Justin Warren <daedalus@eigenmagic.com>

Installation
------------
BEEPy uses distutils, so installation should be really easy. Just
type:

$ python setup.py install

and distutils should take of the rest.

POW, TLS and patented ciphers
-----------------------------
I ran into this issue since I run Debian linux as my main platform.
Since Debian is all free stuff, patented cipher algorithms aren't
compiled into the debian package version of OpenSSL, and hence
aren't available to Python OpenSSL Wrappers (POW). Happily, the
authors of POW know about this and you can compile POW without
requiring patented ciphers.

It is documented as part of the POW package, so check there for the
authoritative word on what's going on, but for me, all I had to do
was disable RC5 when installing POW, thusly:

$ python setup.py build_ext -D NO_RC5_32_12_16 install

Pretty simple, no? Note that this is POW's setup.py, not BEEPy's.

You won't need POW unless you use TLS in your clients or servers.

Getting Started
---------------
The best place to start is to check that BEEPy has been correctly
installed, and is working properly. You can do this by running
twisted's trial utility to run all the unittests.

Change into the directory you extracted the BEEPy source into,
and then run:

$ trial test

Using It
--------
More detailed instructions on using the library are given in doc/HOWTO
including an example client and server.
