Installation
------------
BEEPy uses distutils, so installation should be really easy. Just
type:

$ python setup.py install

and distutils should take of the rest.

Getting Started
---------------
The best place to get started with BEEPy is to change into the test
directory thus:

$ cd beep/test

From here, you can run the unittest suite to check that everything is
working. This should work if you've installed the library or not.

$ python testall.py

or, for more verbose testing:

$ python testall.py -v

Keep in mind that this library is still very much in development, so it's
likely that you'll see a lot of debug information. You want to be
watching for any ERRORs that occur. I try to make sure that the code passes
all unittests before releasing a package so any ERRORs are likely platform
difference problems. I want to hear about them, so log onto sourceforge
and log a bug or send an email to the beepy-devel list.

Using It
--------
More detailed instructions on using the library are given in doc/HOWTO including
an example client and server.
