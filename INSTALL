Installation
------------
BEEPy uses distutils, so installation should be really easy. Just
type:

$ python setup.py install

and distutils should take of the rest.

POW, TLS and patented ciphers
-----------------------------
I ran into this issue since I run Debian linux as my main platform.
Since Debian is all free stuff, patented cipher algorithms aren't
compiled into the debian package version of OpenSSL, and hence
aren't available to Python OpenSSL Wrappers (POW). Happily, the
authors of POW know about this and you can compile POW without
requiring patented ciphers.

It is documented as part of the POW package, so check there for the
authoritative word on what's going on, but for me, all I had to do
was disable RC5 when installing POW, thusly:

$ python setup.py build_ext -D NO_RC5_32_12_16 install

Pretty simple, no? Note that this is POW's setup.py, not BEEPy's.

You won't need POW unless you use TLS in your clients or servers.

Getting Started
---------------
The best place to get started with BEEPy is to change into the test
directory thus:

$ cd beep/test

From here, you can run the unittest suite to check that everything is
working. This should work if you've installed the library or not.

$ python testall.py

or, for more verbose testing:

$ python testall.py -v

By default, debug output is sent to a file in the working directory:
beepy-debug.log.

Using It
--------
More detailed instructions on using the library are given in doc/HOWTO
including an example client and server.
