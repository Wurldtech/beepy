Overview
--------

BEEPy is a library for the Python language that implements the Blocks
Extensible Exchange Protocol as defined in RFCs starting with RFC 3080.
For more information on the protocol itself, check out 
http://www.beepcore.org/.

BEEPy attempts to implement the protocol as a library written from the
ground up in Python, using the native Python libraries wherever possible.
This helps make BEEPy portable to any platform with the standard Python
interpreter installed.

BEEPy is very much a work in progress. Suggestions, feature requests,
bug reports, etc. are all welcome. Chances are you received this copy
via the BEEPy site on SourceForge, but in case you didn't, go here
