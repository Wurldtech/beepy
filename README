Beepy is the only BEEP protocol implementation for twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com>.

It appears to have been developed and tested only against itself, not against
any other conformant BEEP implementations, and it didn't interoperate.

We hacked it to interoperate with beep4j, and to perform adequately for our
needs. We're pushing the code in the hopes it will be of use, but with
ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES.

The upstream-master branch is a git-svn clone of :pserver:anonymous@beepy.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beepy 

Note that the author changed the license from LGPL to MIT. We haven't merged
this into our master yet, but anybody who prefers MIT can do so. Our changes
are dual-licensed and can be used under the terms of the original LGPL or the
updated MIT license.

BEEPy - A Python BEEP Library
=============================

Copyright (c) 2002-2004 Justin Warren <daedalus@eigenmagic.com>

Overview
--------

BEEPy is a library for the Python language that implements the Blocks
Extensible Exchange Protocol as defined in RFCs starting with RFC 3080.
For more information on the protocol itself, check out 
http://www.beepcore.org/.

BEEPy attempts to implement the protocol as a library written from the
ground up in Python. This helps make BEEPy portable to any platform
with the standard Python interpreter installed. 

BEEPy is written using the twisted framework (http://www.twisted-matrix.com)
to implement asynchronous network communications. You will need to have
twisted installed to make use of BEEPy.

BEEPy is very much a work in progress. Suggestions, feature requests,
bug reports, etc. are all welcome. Chances are you received this copy
via the BEEPy site on SourceForge, but in case you didn't, go here
