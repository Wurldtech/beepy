# BEEPy - A Python BEEP Library
# Copyright (c) 2002-2007 Justin Warren <daedalus@eigenmagic.com>

Overview
--------

BEEPy is a library for the Python language that implements the Blocks
Extensible Exchange Protocol as defined in RFCs starting with RFC 3080.
For more information on the protocol itself, check out 
http://www.beepcore.org/.

BEEPy attempts to implement the protocol as a library written from the
ground up in Python. This helps make BEEPy portable to any platform
with the standard Python interpreter installed. 

BEEPy is written using the twisted framework (http://www.twisted-matrix.com)
to implement asynchronous network communications. You will need to have
twisted installed to make use of BEEPy.

BEEPy is very much a work in progress. Suggestions, feature requests,
bug reports, etc. are all welcome. Chances are you received this copy
via the BEEPy site on SourceForge, but in case you didn't, go here
