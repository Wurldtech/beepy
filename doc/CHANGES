0.1a -> 0.2a
------------
- mgmtparser.py Parser now ignores whitespace outside element tags, thus
  creating fewer elements within a dom.document, saving on memory.
- Re-implemented Session as a finite state machine. Session is now a subclass 
  of StateMachine with a defined set of states and reasons to transition. 
  Transports define the details of the state transitions by implementing the 
  state handlers.
- Start and close of channels works for successful cases between an Initiator
  and a Listener. Error handling is minimal.
- The use of Channel.deallocateMsgno() is now expected to be performed by a
  Channel's Profile to ensure that messages are only marked as completely
  received once the Profile is ready, rather than when they get placed onto
  the Channel queue.
- tcpsession.TCPCommsMixin.getInputFrame() now correctly processes multiple
  frames received within a single datablock instead of just the first one.
