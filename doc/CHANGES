0.1a -> 0.2a
------------
- mgmtparser.py Parser now ignores whitespace outside element tags, thus
  creating fewer elements within a dom.document, saving on memory.
- Re-implemented Session as a finite state machine. Session is now a subclass 
  of StateMachine with a defined set of states and reasons to transition. 
  Transports define the details of the state transitions by implementing the 
  state handlers.
- Various bugfixes and cleanup.
