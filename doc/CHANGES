0.3 -> 0.4
----------
- Improved logging, now with customisable prefix format and shorter
  time output.
- Asynchronous threading for greater efficiency.
- Cleaner inheritance model


0.2a -> 0.3
------------
- distutils now used for packaging and install.
- Test scripts moved to top level directory.
- SASL/OTP basics implemented. Implementation to be completed and
  more thoroughly tested and bugfixed.
- Fixed bugs in SASL/ANONYMOUS with client/server interaction and 
  channel/session closure.
- Fixed a bug in tcpsession.py so that if a frame is received and
  the payload is longer than specified in the header the session
  is dropped immediately. Previously it would only check sizes after
  a complete frame was received or the input buffer was full. It now
  implements the correct behaviour which is also more robust against
  attempted Denial of Service attacks.
- Test scripts do fairly complete testing of the BEEP framing
  implemented by BEEPy.

0.1a -> 0.2a
------------
- mgmtparser.py Parser now ignores whitespace outside element tags, thus
  creating fewer elements within a dom.document, saving on memory.
- Re-implemented Session as a finite state machine. Session is now a subclass 
  of StateMachine with a defined set of states and reasons to transition. 
  Transports define the details of the state transitions by implementing the 
  state handlers.
- Start and close of channels works for successful cases between an Initiator
  and a Listener. Error handling is minimal.
- The use of Channel.deallocateMsgno() is now expected to be performed by a
  Channel's Profile to ensure that messages are only marked as completely
  received once the Profile is ready, rather than when they get placed onto
  the Channel queue.
- tcpsession.TCPCommsMixin.getInputFrame() now correctly processes multiple
  frames received within a single datablock instead of just the first one.
- Added an example client/server implementation using BEEPy and the Echo
  profile. Walkthrough of how to use the library in doc/HOWTO uses it as
  an example.
