- Channel.pull() returns a message instead of a frame. why?
- Channel.allocateRemoteSeqno() and similar: check for need for mutex
  because of concurrency and synchronisation issues.
- Possible rationalisation of Exceptions classes in some cases. I'm having
  to draw lots of Exception classes in Dia to document this thing. I wonder
  if string comparison is quicker than class instanciation during exception
  processing?
- architecture.dia: SEQFrame.type == 'SEQ'. Is this in beep.core.constants
  somewhere, and why?
- beep.core.message should probably be moved to beep.core.profiles since
  message is an enabling class for the BEEPMgmtProfile class. mgmtcreator
  and mgmtparser can probably be moved too, since the mgmt thingo is
  structured in as a profile, not core anymore.
