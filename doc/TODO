- Write the FAQ

- Check over the session shutdown code to streamline it. It's too
  complex at the moment so that even I have trouble following it, and
  I wrote the damn thing.

- Add more callback hooks to the code for easy subclassing, a la
  channelCloseError().

- Increase error handling mechanisms.

- Fix channel priority algorithm to provide a more intelligent window
  sizing mechanism. The priority level in the Channel should map to an
  intuitive real bandwidth priority at the transport layer. The current
  method seems to exhibit no real difference between the levels. Need to
  review what is provided for in the RFCs.

- Add profile priorities for when a client might ask to start a channel
  and give a list of profiles. The server will then pick the one that it
  knows about that has the highest priority. This allows the server to
  prefer SASL/OTP over SASL/ANONYMOUS, for example.

- Add a Stress and Volume test to the test suite to see how the library
  performs under load. This will probably have to wait a little while until
  the library is a little bit more stable.
  Some work on this item has been done, but more is required as the
  library API stabilises.

- More use of twisted mechanisms such as Deferreds now that I have a better
  idea of how they work.

- General review of class structure and API. Should be cleaned up and made
  more intuitive. Do this in conjunction with beepy-devel list.

- Write a test application to show off BEEP and beepy. Any suggestions?
