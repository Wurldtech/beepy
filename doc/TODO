- Channel.pull() returns a message instead of a frame. why?
- Channel.allocateRemoteSeqno() and similar: check for need for mutex
  because of concurrency and synchronisation issues.
- Possible rationalisation of Exceptions classes in some cases. I'm having
  to draw lots of Exception classes in Dia to document this thing. I wonder
  if string comparison is quicker than class instanciation during exception
  processing? Update: May not be an issue so much any more as I've
  deleted a whole swag of exceptions now.
- architecture.dia: SEQFrame.type == 'SEQ'. Is this in beep.core.constants
  somewhere, and why?
- beep.core.message should probably be moved to beep.core.profiles since
  message is an enabling class for the BEEPMgmtProfile class. mgmtcreator
  and mgmtparser can probably be moved too, since the mgmt thingo is
  structured in as a profile, not core anymore.
- If we define the URI for a profile when we add it to a ProfileDict, 
  why does the Profile have a uri attribute? Completeness?
- Where does fragmentation get handled? Probably should be in the
  transport code somewhere, so we need to be careful with buffer overflows
  in the rest of the code. This is for sending of frames only as frame
  reassembly works correctly on reception, including DoS prevention
  and checking for buffer overflow.
- Add profile priorities for when a client might ask to start a channel
  and give a list of profiles. The server will then pick the one that it
  knows about that has the highest priority. This allows the server to
  prefer SASL/OTP over SASL/ANONYMOUS, for example.
- Should probably moving Threading back up into Session or as a Mixin.
  Now using an Event to signal shutdown of a Session thread. I like this
  more, as it seems a little more structured.. and probably should be done
  similarly, since we're talking about inter-Thread comms.
- It appears the default scheduling algorithm is busy-waiting, which is
  bad. Should modify this to a better async model at some stage. That will
  get quite complex and I'll have to look up my old operating system notes.
  It'd be nice to have priority processes, like nice(1).
- I'm not happy with the use of struct.pack() in saslotpprofile.py. Having
  to refer to each value in a list in order to pack it into an 8 byte
  string is annoying and wrong. Perhaps a loop using chr() would be more
  appropriate.
